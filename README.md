There are two other team members but I could not get in contact with them. I tried email, canvas, and MS Teams with no success.
As a result, all the work for HW1 in this repository is done by me, David Gibson.

The file is for jupyter notebook.
It imports from sklearn, matplotlib, and pandas

I did not finish implementing the entire loop. It loops k from 1 through 20, but I did not do the five repititions for average accuracy.
As a result, I can only make an educated guess for which K has the best accuracy based on what I saw during testing.
It appeared to me that the k values around 5 seemed to have consistently high accuracy.
